# Projects
Hello! 
Welcome to this repository where I will upload on time to times, certain projects related to:
* Data Science; 
* Data Analysis;
* Web Application;
* Other stuff


The skills related to Data Science and Analysis, using _Python_ I've learned them in the year 2020, where I followed a course with the _EPFL Extension School_ while looking for a job.

## Web Application
Here there are some web application I have created using the _Streamlit_ Python package. There are no scientific goal to them, just learn how to use this package.
In the appropriate folder you can find the _Jupyter Notebook_ files of them, where I did some test and some quick data analysis.
