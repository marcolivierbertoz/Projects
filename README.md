Hello! 
Welcome to this repository where I will upload on time to times, certain projects related to:
* Data Science; 
* Data Analysis;
* Web Application;
* Other stuff


The skills related to Data Science and Analysis, using _Python_ I've learned them in the year 2020, where I followed a course with the _EPFL Extension School_.

## Web Application
Here there are some web application that have been created.

> The Web App are located on _Heroku_ platform, not all the app could be active at the same time.
